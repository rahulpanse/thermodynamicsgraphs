# thermodynamicsgraphs
This repository will contain the file which will contain the code for the graph which are used in the book.
In the python file, you will see the code for all of the graphs. I believe the code is 315 lines long. 
In the paper, there is a graph for the plot of Helium gas at Kauzmann temperature. I have not coded it. I have, however, referenced it.
